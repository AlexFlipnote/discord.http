## Disclaimer
Overall, discord.http/gateway is beta-ready.
Things are still changing, so please do not use this library in production.

## Todo list
- [x] Handling of all gateway intent events
- [x] Prevent `GUILD_CREATE` from being dispatched before `SHARD_READY`
- [ ] Ability to set playing status on boot and change later
- [ ] Properly handle all needed cache flags
- [ ] Handling of chunking members
- [ ] Handling of ratelimits
